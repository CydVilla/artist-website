\# Ana Ion's Artist Archive

Welcome to Ana Ion's archive of artistry. This space represents a culmination of digital drawings, paintings, and expressive pieces from over four enriching years of artistic exploration. It's a reflection of my journey, a space that feels like the digital equivalent of a canvas-rich studio ‚Äî reminiscent of an Instagram feed, yet uniquely mine and devoid of its transience.

## üñº Storing the Canvas
My art pieces find their digital haven in a separate GitHub repository for optimized storage and maintenance: [https://github.com/cydvilla/art-images](https://github.com/cydvilla/art-images). This space is also where each piece is transformed into accessible links and thumbnails, ensuring that every visitor has a seamless experience on the main website.

## üé® Website Features
Here's what my art platform currently offers:

1. **Automated Uploads:** Art pieces from the art-images repository are automatically showcased here.
2. **Chronological Grid View:** A panoramic view of my artistic journey from the most recent creation (top-left corner) to the first stroke.
3. **Adaptive View:** A slider allows viewers to adjust the grid size, tailoring the experience to their liking.
4. **Detailed Image View:** On selecting an art piece:
   - It expands to full size.
   - Navigate using arrow keys or on-screen arrows.
   - Creation dates etched below for context.
5. **Personal Notes:** A dedicated section below the grid where I occasionally share musings, thoughts, or the story behind certain pieces.
